# Teacher's Pet

## Background 

Teachers have one of the most integral jobs because they’re tasked with educating the next generation of thinkers. Unfortunately, teachers confront on a daily basis numerous insurmountable obstacles from being able to succeed at their jobs. They deserve better than having to deal with mundane and tedious tasks such as frequently writing repetitive student progress reports.

  

In fact, the current landscape of digital teacher aids does not sufficiently address these challenges. Insert Teacher’s Pet, the first free app that provides teachers with a seamless structure for creating detailed student reports in less than one minute.

  

Teachers can track all of their classes and students for the school year, and view student performance for each profile over time.

  

In this way, Teacher’s Pet is not only helping teachers succeed but also future generations.
